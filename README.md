# OMA-repom
This is the code repository for my first coding activity in python.
This application is meant to be made in diffirent modules. 
The project is a work of one developer a student at Makerere University. 
The main objective in creating this project is to widen my programming language in python3 more so with the use of the kivy python framework that has the capability to create cross platform applicatons. This application will need extra  knowledge in the data analysis field which field is one of the ideal field I would like to venture in with time. Enjoy
